Project Remake !! (Better Maintence Now)

<--=Hello, this is a Description of the actual Status of the project, the Bugs Know and some other infos=--> 

[Oh i Don't know if my english is very correct, sorry for any error on Write this]

Why This ?? {
    so i started to think about it when i was trying to build an another counter not this.
    this is a remake with some Upgraded Script and a really better CSS.
    then i would like to understand how to do a Loop and be able to use a button or anything else while doing a loop action or this type of action.
    so a search in Websites like GithHub StackOverFlow and MDN to find the structure to split actions and enable two actions to be done at the same time.
    and i reach at the 'setInterval' and the 'clearInterval' and then i could build the Count Project that is a Cronometer at Really
