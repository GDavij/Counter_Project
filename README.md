<--=Hello, this is a Description of the actual Status of the project, the Bugs Know and some other infos=--> 

[Oh i Don't know if my english is very correct, sorry for any error on Write this]

Why This ?? {
    so i started to think about it when i was trying to build an another counter not this.
    this is a remake with some Upgraded Script and a really better CSS.
    then i would like to understand how to do a Loop and be able to use a button or anything else while doing a loop action or this type of action.
    so a search in Websites like GithHub StackOverFlow and MDN to find the structure to split actions and enable two actions to be done at the same time.
    and i reach at the 'setInterval' and the 'clearInterval' and then i could build the Count Project that is a Cronometer at Really
}


Bugs Know?? {
    yeah i found a bug while testing my code for a time and it seems that a part of my screen Frezze, that is the part of the 'TimeGlobal[3]', the one that pass really fast.
    so.. by this that's all i know of the bugs on it , uhm... if u would try, try it at your on risk, but by what it seems it clears with time when screen and the PC is Off
    if u have a solution fell free to help
}

Info's ?? {
    so HTML Version is on 'Alpha0.1' Cause i still doesn't have put all the funcionalites on it like an limit to Cronometer, the Start an End Counter Data and ETC that an "Clock" Can do
    the CSS Version is 'Alpha0.1' Cause i don't know if i will let the style this way and the page position can have some trouble seems the fact that it doesn't fit when u put it bigger or tiner (i think it is because of 'position: FIXED ;' , but this i will fix soon when i probaly ReMake the Posistions of the elements and ETC)
    the JavaScript Version is '0.1' Cause by what it seems it is very stable and works, and it needs just some more improvements and add Actions
    So i run the HTML on Microsoft EDGE and MOZZILA and it seems to have no problem
